                        SliceHack -- Changelog
                        
This file describes SliceHack's changes from SpliceHack and (below) the
changelog for SpliceHack.

********************************************************************************
*	Release 0.4.1 'Helm of Opposite Alignment'

	Merge everything up to 6 Nov from Splice, which includes Nethack 3.6.2
	This has not been tested much...

********************************************************************************
*	Release 0.4.0 'Dragon Helm'

	The big stuff:

*   New Dragon Armor
    
    This patch introduces dragon shields, dragon helms, dragonhide
    gauntlets, and dragonhide boots. These items have the same extrinsic
    that the mail and scales provide and 3 AC. To make them you need to
    wear scales in the shield, helm, gloves or boots slot and read a
    scroll of enchant armor. This means that this patch also incudes
    support for multislot armors, and because this makes the unenchanted
    scales a more powerful item they are now a little heavier and have
    only 1 AC.
    
    A confused scroll of enchant armor's usual use doesn't apply to dragon
    armor, so it can now be used to turn scales into a random dragon armor
    (this is not useful) or turn a dragon armor back into scales (which
    might be useful, if you wanted it in a different form.)
    
    These are powerful items, and the intent is to give more variety to
    ascension kits but without making things overly powerful and trying to
    avoid items being strictly better than an existing item - although not
    if this is at the expense of consistency.
    
    For this reason, dragons are classified as "common" (chromatic),
    "rare" (black, silver, grey, shimmering, purple), "high" (hex, filth,
    ooze, razor) and "never generated" (void). You can wear common items
    in any combination, but you can only wear one colour of rare (or
    better) items at any time, and so only get one property from them.
    (So, for example, that silver dragon shield is lighter and more
    protective than a shield of reflection - but it won't cooperate with
    your grey dragon scale mail.)
    
    All but the void dragon scales are randomly generated, but only deep
    and very rarely. You are still expected to be more likely to get
    dragon armor by killing a dragon - or wishing for it. They are also
    now considered magical, so you can't easily polypile for them.

*	Announce the finding of artifacts
    When an artifact is encountered for the first time (by wielding it,
    or having it used against you) some will print an intro (some taken
    from the encylopedia entries). Some have alternative messages seen
    when hallucinating.

*	Add Nephi's Bane Boosting patch
    
    Ported from 3.4.3.
    Changes I have kept are:
    Grimtooth:   permanently poisoned
	Orcrist:     warning (of orcs)
    Dragonbane:  warning, +d8 hit / +d20 damage, reflection.
    Demonbane:   warning, +d8 hit / +d20 damage, drain resistance, prevent
        demons gating.
    Werebane:    warning, +d8 hit / +d20 damage.
    Ogresmasher: warning, +d8 hit / +d20 damage.
    Giantslayer: warning, +d8 hit / +d20 damage, kill seven giants at one
        blow on a natural 20.
    Trollsbane:  warning, +d8 hit / +d20 damage, hungerless regeneration,
        trolls don't revive.
    
    Changes I have nerfed:
    
    Sunsword:    warning (undead), +d8 hit / +d12 damage, blind on hit.
        (The original patch had +d20 damage)
    
    Changes I have skipped:
    
    Vorpal Blade and Muramasa - they don't need buffing!

*   Theme chests
    
    Some chests and large boxes (more often those with a lot of stuff)
    are 'themed' which at the moment just means that all items are from
    the same class. The numbers of items in a box has also been changed,
    so than occasionally larger numbers of items will be seen, and locked
    and especially trapped boxes usually have some loot in. (The average
    number of items generated in containers should not have changed much
    though, and the distribution of item classes should also be
    unchanged.)

*	Added the artifact "Quick Blade".

    Quick Blade is an (iron) saber with the property that a successful hit
    with it takes half the usual turn time. The result is comparable to
    double damage but is more powerful (attacks can be split between
    opponents, especially when one dies with the first hit) and reliable
    (with two attacks against the same opponent you have another chance
    to hit).
    
    That does only apply in the ideal case of hitting every time, though.
    
    You can expect 9 average damage at +0 and 23 at +7 - the same as
    Grayswandir, but without the silver damage.
    
    It's intended to be a AK-worthy but not overpowered (compared to Frost
    Brand, for example) weapon that encourages a different tactical style,
    with Archeologists (as the only role which can gain Expert in saber)
    being especially targeted... though it probably needs some tweaking as
    yet.

*	Added a modified version of Topi Linkala's Owned Artifacts patch.

	Artifacts have an owner. If you wish for an artifact there is an
    increasing chance with each wish that you will get the artifact
    only after killing its guardian. These are generally player-monsters
    of a type associated with that artifact (e.g. blunt instruments get
    a Priest, Stormy gets a Barbarian...). There are a few special cases
    (Thiefbane, King in Yellow, Vladbane), and quest artifacts will
    sometimes bring in the associated nemesis!

*	HP changes: precalculate HP
    
    HP gain from role/race is now precalculated at character creation,
    and constrained to give a (very close to) average HP at level 30.

	Splits the part of level-based max HP gain which is
    based on Con into an independent bonus which is updated whenever Con
    or level changes. The result is that your current max HP depends on
    your current Con, rather than the history of Con at level gain.
    
    As most characters gain Con over the game, the average Con gain has
    been adjusted down slightly (in the previous patch) intending to
    end up with no change to typical HP. Other effects are that items
    which boost Con are more valuable, while loss of Con is more
    immediately dangerous (although without any long-term effects once
    restored). It is possible to lose 1HP on level up, but only if you
    have 5 or less Con. Some kinds of "drain for gain" are prevented.

	Increases don't change when repeated -i n the same way than drained
	levels use the record of the amount of
    HP gained when the level was gained, levels regained now also use
    the record and so gain the same amount as the first time.

*	Added the Wizardstaff
    
    A wizardstaff is a weapon similar to a quarterstaff. For non-wizard
    roles it is almost exactly the same, the only difference being the
    high price. All sub-roles of the wizard role can make use of one, but
    only the Wizard sub-role starts with one. (They are randomly generated
    but very rare - and it would be a reasonable use of a wish.)
    
    When wielding a wizardstaff, if you are at maximum energy then you
    will charge it - the stored energy increases and this is reflected in
    the enchantment. 10 energy is equivalent to +1 to enchantment and
    takes 50 turns to recover. The upper limit increases with level from
    +1 at level 1 to +7 at level 30. (You can charge it quickly with a
    scroll of enchant weapon, but not beyond its limit.)
    
    If you attempt to cast a spell without sufficient energy, you can draw
    energy from the staff to make up the difference, leaving you with 0
    energy. This happens before blood magic, if you have both. The staff's
    enchantment will go down again - it's always proportional to the
    stored energy.
 
    The existing artifact quartstaff 'Balance' has been made into a
    wizardstaff. The + to damage has been reduced to d3 from d6 to allow
    for it being easier to enchant, and the price increased.
    
    You can exchange, unwield, drop etc. a staff without losing energy.
    However if you have more than one wizardstaff, and change between them
    then as you wield a staff which is not the one which you last wielded,
    then it will become "attuned" to you and drain back to +0. (Otherwise
    a large collection of wizardstaffs would be an almost unlimited
    energy pool.)

*   Improved Wish
    
    An improved wish is one in which specified numbers (enchantment,
    charges, size of stack) are biased to allow you to get more (or
    less, although that's not used yet).
    
    The only way to get an improved wish is to break a wand of wishing
    which either has at least one charge left, or which has not been
    recharged. (Not having been recharged is equivalent to one more
    charge). Such a wand can (with the wrest charge) be used to make
    at least two wishes, which you are giving up for one more powerful
    wish.
    
    Each additional charge increases stack sizes by 50%, maximum wand
    charge by 1 and maximum armor or weapon enchantment by 1. It doesn't
    otherwise change the way that enchantment is handled, so it's still
    not guaranteed to get more than +1 - although the average is higher
    and it is possible (if very chancy) to get more than +5.
    
*	Patric Mueller's Harmonic Scoring
    
    Limits scoring by changing the score per monster kill.
    Scores grow without limit. For every killed monster the player gets
    the same number of points.
    
    For regular monsters this is not really a problem as after a specific
    number of kills these monsters won't be generated again. Unique
    monsters like the Wizard of Yendor or the riders can be killed
    infinite times.
    
    The Harmonic Scoring Patch decouples the score points per monster
    kill from the experience points and decreases them continuously with
    every kill.
    
    For the first kill, the complete points are awarded, the second kill
    yields only half points, the third kill only a third, etc.
    
    This leads to smaller scores. For the early and mid game scores are
    about half as large. For the late game and pre-ascension, the score
    is between 0.5 and 2 million points.
    
    With this method of scoring the doubling of the score and counting of
    the value of the items for an ascension have again a noticeable impact
    on the final score.

*	Knights can handle heavy armor better
    
    If you are wearing armor weighting 200 or more, the effective weight
    for encumbrance is reduced by half the weight above 200. (E.g. plate
    weighing 450 is reduced to 200+((450-200)/2), or 325.)

*	Port Stevie-O's level teleporter jump patch
    
    ^T while standing on a level teleporter activates the trap.
    Sometimes (especially if you have teleport control) you *want* to use
    a teleportation trap. Pressing ^T while standing on a intralevel
    teleporter will print "You jump onto the teleportation trap." and
    activate the trap. For a level teleporter, however, the only way to
    use the trap is to remove any and all objects providing MR (CoMR, Eye
    of Aethiopica, Grey DSM, wielded Magicbane, ...), step off of the
    trap, and then step back onto it.
    
    This patch modifies the ^T command slightly so that if invoked while
    standing on a level teleporter, the game asks "There is a level
    teleporter here. Jump in? [yn]". If the user chooses 'y', the
    teleporter is activated as if you had no MR. Choosing 'n' will
    fall through to the original logic (using the Teleport Away spell,
    or exploiting teleportitis with TC).

*	Add L's damage messages patch (with some new hallu adverbs)
    
    Healers get extra feedback on how damaged a monster is when you hit
    it in melee, with a projectile, or a spell/ray - or directly using
    the ';' key.

*	Drop the Dead Dragon
    
    Dragonmasters can no longer eat dragons - it is considered
    cannibalism.
    
    This make sense thematically (for the same reasons that they can't
    wear DSM) but of course makes it more difficult to gain intrinsics,
    and disintegration in particular has no non-dragon source.
    
    So they will now gain all intrinsics that can be had from a common
    dragon with experience - but late enough that they will still benefit
    from finding other sources early. (Most characters will have poison
    and sleep resistance at least by the time they encounter their first
    dragon, and quite likely fire and cold as well.)
    
    Level   Intrinsic
    15      Poison
    16      Sleep
    18      Fire
    19      Cold
    21      Shock
    23      Disintegration


	Minor features:
*	Fix Demogorgon / quest banishment message mixup
*	Castle soldiers don't fall through the trapdoors
	It is common for lots of soldiers and other Castle monsters to fall
    through the trapdoors into the Valley. This doesn't make much sense,
    they set the traps after all and should know where they are - and it
    doesn't help the appearance of the Valley either.
    So monsters will now avoid a trap (as if they had already encountered
    one of its type before) if:
    It is the Castle, Ludios or Quest End level (it's not an obvious
    problem for Ludios or Quest End, but the same reasoning applies),
    and the monster is a non-mindless humanoid.
*	Scrolls of earth have a confused effect:
	If cursed, summon level appropriate numbers of hostile earth
	elementals and/or dust vortices.
	If uncursed, earthquake (like the drum), radius 5.
	If blessed, earthquake, radius 8.
*	Legendary lichens don't rot
*	Give Pestilence poisoned arrows along with the bow
*	Reading warp armor/weapon confused causes polymorph
*	Objects generated on the rogue level are always of base material
*	No (lower case) packrat special generation on the rogue level
*	Unicorns should sometimes carry a (real) gem.
*	Slings do double damage against giants. Including player giants.
*	Fire Brand is fiery:
	A hit against an ice vortex "melts part of" it (like the message with
	water elementals, this doesn't affect damage - it's just a more
	accurate message - water doesn't burn!)
	A hit against a "flammable" monster instantly kills it. (all walking
	trees, the wood, paper and straw golems, and the green slime.)
*	Deck of Fate special cases
    If you are polymorphed into "royalty" (ogre king, etc.) you get a
    different message and no bad effect if you draw "The Emperor".
    If you are at least Pious and have not angered the gods, you can
    also get a good effect (instead of punishment) from Judgement.
    ...it's probably still not a good idea to use it, though.
*	Cartomancers can use playing cards or decks of fate as if blessed
*	Baby dragons can be generated, but rarely when adults are in level.
*	Worms that walk always dissolve into many maggots, never just one
*	Hobbits carry food
*	Misc hallucinatory objects, monsters, messages etc.
*	In wizard mode, all figurines can be wished for.
*	Ghast moved from level 4 to level 6.
    (It's nastier - doing more damage - than the skeletal pirate and
    draugr. Neither of which paralyze, and both are level 5 so the
    ghast looks overpowered at level 4.)
*	Show the experience in the monster info window
*	Avoid alchemy recipes avoid having a large part of the value from one item
    This avoids (for example) a middle-value potion requiring a potion
    of gain ability as one of the ingredients.
*	Archeologists (randomly, or on request) have a pet monkey
    (Think "Raiders of the Lost Ark")
*	Potions of oil can't be diluted with water
*	New monster: colossal slime (which can engulf you)

	Bugs fixed:     
	Stop pets eating their inedible inventory (e.g. saddle).
		(The pet wouldn't consume it but would delay as if eating)
	Database comment for Alchemists
	Fix giants' initial inventory gems
	Ensure that you don't start with poisonous meat, unless you resist
	Larva carrier (using the wrong count) fix
	Fix Giants' extra chance of shattering weapons
	Fix Demogorgon / quest banishment message mixup
	Artifacts which both illuminate and warn have a combined message
	Pets don't get intrinsic gain messages when already having it
	Fuming potions of acid were incorrectly being merged with non-fuming
	Some bogus objs got an extra The
	Add db entries for multi-headed hydras
	Fix giants' shooting penalty
	Fixed Alchemist (choosing subrole, and rarity calcs)
	misc typos, bogobjs, etc.

********************************************************************************
*	Release 0.3.0 'Candy Bar'

	The big stuff:
*	Merged Splice 0.5.0 => 0.6.0.

	Notable changes from this:

	Mind flayers were nerfed in the merge to not cause amnesia, but not here.
	(They are a bit less effective than they used to be, especially if you
	have high Luck, since there are more ways to lose your memory than there
	used to be. But even with maxed Luck, they are still scary.)
	
	Pets will now only avoid chameleon corpses if you haven't touched them.
	
	Brass lanterns are called that again (while still allowing lanterns of
	other materials to exist).

	The merge removed scrolls of pure law, true neutrality and raw chaos. I
	brought them back, but as a single scroll which doesn't care about your
	alignment - as such a rare scroll should not be junk.

*	Added a new item - the holy symbol.
	The holy symbol is an amulet which when worn tells you whether it is
    safe to pray - it's blessed if safe to pray, uncursed if the timeout
    prevents prayer, and cursed if there is some other reason. (It also
    gleams, blackens, etc. when changing BUC.) Because of this, you can't
    curse or bless it while it is worn. Trying to do so will make a small
    difference to prayer timeout, though.
    
    Wearing it also speeds the prayer timeout by 25% - or 50% if you are
    a Priest - and if worn while praying successfully you may get a better
    effect than you otherwise would have. This does depend on Luck.
    
    If noncursed, it can also be invoked for turn undead. This has a long
    timeout, shared between all holy symbols (so that getting lots won't
    help you). Invoking it when it is cursed instead summons undead!
    
    If sacrificed, it is a high value similar to a cross-aligned unicorn.
    Also like a unicorn, sacrificing it on a cross-aligned altar will
    convert you. Wearing it while sacrificing a corpse will increase the
    value similarly to, and cumulatively with, using a sacrificial knife.
    
    If dropped, it will scare vampires (like an altar). Wearing one is OK
    for atheists (if fairly useless), but turning undead is not.
    
    They are uncommon, but priests and similar monsters may carry one and
    there is a small chance of finding one as the Sokoban reward.


	Minor features:
*	Added gauntlets (nonmagical, iron, 2 AC, rare but watch and soldiers may
		have them, and Knights may start with them)
*	Split the "critically low HP" trouble to allow recovery from higher HP
		levels - with less priority compared to other troubles, though.
*	Landmines, if hit by fire, lightning or sonics, can explode.
*	Shriekers draw more purple worms if you are unlucky, but early they can
		be baby ones.
*	Change the object probability encoding. This doesn't do anything in itself
		but allows future objects to have more precise rarity and level limits.
*	Add a wizard mode command (Ctrl-K) to dump object generation chances (by
		creating 1e7 objects and counting how many there are of each type)
*	Un-defer wishes for objects with a material (because the 0.6.0 Splice merge
		rebalances material densities)
*	Horns of plenty will not produce smoky potions (it's a wish engine if you
		have unlimited charging, and a Tourist with the PYEC does)
*	Misc hallucinatory messages etc.
*	Giants can get a staggering strike in unarmed combat against large or huge
		opponents.
*	Give Giants the "Ground Slam" technique.
	
	Bug fixes:
*	Re-order DSMs so scales and mail are in sync, and fix a resist.
*	Monks won't start with meat. (Giants got extra food, which could be a tin
		of meat. Tripe is still OK, because that's for the pet.)
*	Fixed invweight displaying incorrectly (caused by the 0.6.0 merge??)
*	Fixed a flag conflict causing Giants to have the wrong roles allowed
*	Misc typos, comments, etc.
********************************************************************************
*	Release 0.2.0 'Hill Giant'

	The big stuff:
*	Literally. You can now play as a giant.
	Giants have lots of HP, and their maximum strength and constitution is
	25. They have increased carrying capacity. (+100 to capacity, with the
	cap increased to 1400 - that can only be reached with strength and
	constitution maximized, though.) They can also wield a two-handed
	weapon as if it were one-handed. They are not intended as "easy mode",
	though - set against these advantages they are slow (10, vs. normal
	12), have poor dexterity, intelligence and charisma and no shirt,
	armor or cloak slot. This limits AC and makes it difficult to get MR
	and reflection - especially for the Barbarian whose quest artifact
	doesn't provide MR. They also have intrinsic hunger and aggravate
	monster, and can't gain stealth from leveling up. (Other sources do
	work.)

	They can be Neutral or Chaotic, and play as Barbarian, Caveman, Monk
	or Tourist.

	Giants know something about gems - they can all distinguish glass from
	valuable gems and use an uncursed touchstone as if blessed. Most can
	also recognize a few types of gem. Barbarians may also have brought a
	treasure with them, Cavemen might have found a pretty rock and
	Tourists bring no cash but a larger pile of gems. (Monks are above
	such baubles.)

	They can lug boulders around and throw them, and are more effective
	with their favourite weapon - a club - or in unarmed combat, in which
	they have an increased chance to stun their opponent. They are more
	likely to shatter their opponent's weapon with a lucky strike. They
	can't however become very effective with bows, crossbows or slings
	(there is no multishot bonus from skill).

	Kicking down doors, digging, tearing through webs and general feats
	of strength are easier for a giant. Because much of the strength
	gain in a typical game is through eating giant corpses which is now
	taboo - and because it would be silly if a giant typically had less
	strength than a human at the same stage of the game - giants gain
	more from the other sources of strength gain.


* Praying for food has now been made smarter.
	The previous behaviour was to treat any prayer while Weak or worse
	as a serious trouble. It will now first check your inventory for
	food (and your bags, if they are accessible to you) and if there is
	a significant amount you will be expected to eat that first.

	Many exceptions are made - for tins (because of the delay), tripe
	(which might make you sick), eggs (which might be cockatrice), and
	items which are not intended as food (catnip, garlic, wolfsbane,
	eucalyptus, lizards). Corpses and globs are only considered if they
	won't do anything too nasty (stone, slime, poison, acid if low HP,
	domestic animal, cannibalism, or tainted).

	Minor features:
*	Failure Eidolon is scarier. Failure Eidolon had a teleporting attack, which was
		useless as the level was no teleport. Replaced it with a gremlin style
		intrinsic stealing attack.
*	Potions of hallucination may grant enlightenment (1/2 if blessed, 1/5 uncursed).
*	Throne room kings' sceptres are of precious metal, annd may be ornate.
*	Store rooms: a special room with a few boxes and random items, and some rats.
*	You can get Sting by killing a spider in melee with an elven dagger.
*	Wrest wish chances have been tweaked - it starts low but increases. (the idea
		being to both reduce tediosity and reduce the chance of accidental wresting)
*	Add a case to Popeye for chameleon meat vs. sliming (because it is reasonable to
		eat a tin of deep fried chameleon to stop sliming, intending to turn into
		a fiery monster. Even without poly control - it would be a slim chance but
		might be the only possibility.)
*	Lords as well as princes get quality arms - though to a lesser extent.
*	Merfolk equipment is rustproof. Merfolk were dropping tridents which rusted when
		they hit the water. This looks silly, so they have been made rustproof.
*	Long worms taste spicy.
*	Cursed landmines can randomly explode.
*	Hallucinatory monsters, randomized names, etc.
*	Artifact generation chance now depends on Luck, and Pirates get more.

	Bug fixes:
*	Weights for items with changed materials fixed (e.g. wood golems producing
		things that were wooden, but had the weight of a different material
		because they were first generated in that material and then changed to
		be wood without changing the weight). This fixes corrosion also.
*	When enchanting a worm tooth or reverting a crysknife, the material should change.
*	Fix artifact messages (such as you get when wielding War's Sword) being seen
		twice on restore - they now don't show up at all when restoring.
*	There are no glass or plastic mattocks (previously this applied only to pickaxes).
*	Fix "wooden shield of reflection" (shiny_materials had less than 100%).
*	Zombies created by a zombiemaker's attack now become hostile.
*	Magic chests are not described as being empty (their contents is unknown)
*	Compile warning fixes, typos, etc.

********************************************************************************
*	Release 0.1.1 'Horseshoe Amulet'

	Major changes:
*	Reading a scroll of enchant armor while not wearing any armor has
		these effects:

		Blessed             As the spell "protection" cast d3 times as expert
		Uncursed            As the spell "protection" cast once at low skill
		Cursed              Nothing
		Blessed confused    As a blessed potion of restore ability
		Uncursed confused   As an uncursed potion of restore ability
		Cursed confused     Lose 1 point of a random stat

		The existing abuse (cursed) or exercise (otherwise) of CON and STR
		remains.

*	Add a new amulet, the gorget. A gorget is a piece of armor worn in the amulet
		slot. It has 2 base AC, is made of iron (or alternate metal material),
		and can be enchanted like other armor. Like other metal armor, it
		hurts spellcasting.

	Small changes:
*	Some random items may be generated rusty, eroded or erodeproof
*	Baby purple worm vs shrieker: fight!
*	Throwing a fuming potion of acid up goes boom
*	Pet behaviour has been tweaked to be less predictable and less likely to kill
		themselves - they don't take on such high level opponents when they are injured.
*	Enchantment/charge (rne()) has been replaced by a function which models the chance
		of getting it by scrolls. The upshot is that your chances are biased by Luck,
		not level - and you always have some chance of getting a high +, but it's rare.

	Bug fixes:
*	Fix smashing glass objects in a kicked box.
*	Fix an assert failure in alchemy.
*	Add code to prevent an alchemical potion recipe being produced which is
		impossible to make because every route to it first produces a different potion.
*	Statues, containers and random objects placed in rooms will now only
		be placed on ACCESSIBLE grids, so not on a tree.
*	Zombie appearance fixed.

********************************************************************************
*	Release 0.1.0 'Tripe Ration'

	It's now playable enough that it's my standard Nethack fix, rather
	than SpliceHack. Try it! (Especially try the Alchemist sub-role.)

*	The big stuff:
*	Zombie Apocalypse!
	Zombies are no longer boring.
    They have a attack which can (with chance increasing for higher level
	zombies) drain one or more points of INT. This can't kill though
    brainlessness or cause memory loss - it's not the same as a mind
    flayer's attack. (This is not expected to make things much more
    difficult - they are slow and can be attacked from range, and you
    won't have encountered many before you get a a unicorn horn.) It can
    also cause confusion. (Anything described as a zombie has this attack,
    as do ghouls. Draugr and skeletal pirates are Z's but are weapon users
    so do not. Nor do skeletons - they are weapon / slow-touch users.)
    
    If a zombie kills a monster with a zombie form, it will rise again as
    a zombie. Liches also have this ability, and zombies will attack any
    monster which can be zombified. If you are killed by a zombie, the
    same thing happens and there will be a zombie instead of a ghost in
    the bones file.
    
    A few new zombie types have also been added, to provide more targets
    for zombies to attack (and add some variety).

*	Sub-roles (and the Alchemist).
	Sub-roles are a way to define a subset of a role which can be selected
    at character creation. They take effect by changing the restrictions
    (alignment, race, gender) on the role, by changing members of urole and
    by containing a subrole ID which can be checked with Subrole_if and
    Subrole_switch, which behave like Role_if and Role_switch. They are
    intended for variations on a role which don't require a whole new role,
    especially if they are to share the same Quest.
    
    This patch breaks savefile compatibility and requires window system
    support - it includes support only for curses.

	The Alchemist is a variant Wizard with starting equipment biased
    towards potions (especially potions of acid), along with an
    alchemist's smock.
    
    Alchemists can brew potions using recipes which involves dipping
    one or more items into a potion of acid. They blow stuff up a lot
    but can create any potion - limited by the availability of the
    ingredients and the new Alchemy skill. It is intended to complement,
    not replace, the existing potion-mixing effects which have not been
    modified.

*	Deflate experience levels
    
    The previous thresholds for level gain increased fast enough that
    beyond mid-levels it wasn't practical to level up through combat.
    The replacement table is similar early but finishes at 1e6, not
    1e8 and was made assuming that most games would include a few
    level-ups, but more levels would be gained by experience than level
    up. It's probably not very well balanced yet, though...


*	Small changes:
*	Ask for confirmation when throwing arrows (If you are throwing
	arrows despite having a bow in your swap slot, this is probably a
	mistake. So ask for confirmation before throwing. It uses a
	paranoid_query so can be turned off.)
*	Add a paranoid-confirmation late quit option.
*	Add a message for avoiding lava/water (telling you how to force it)
*	When a flaming or shocking sphere explodes in your face, you now get
    a real 3x3 explosion - of the element, which can be resisted. Tame
    spheres will also explode when they hit, and gas spores now produce
    a gas cloud when they explode.
*	Add the "kaboom" challenge mode, making items randomly explode.
*	Amulet versus stone. (Resists stoning, stops stoning when put on,
	deflects thrown rocks, gives extra damage vs stone golems, speeds
	digging)
*	Add the "surrounded" trouble - if there are too many monsters around
	you (the number depends on how many free spaces there are nearby),
	#pray can teleport you away (and if you had low enough HP that you
	could have got healed, you will get that effect too.). It's intended
	to catch both "surrounded in an open space" and "trapped in a dead end".
*	Allow you to sit on a cockatrice corpse, and turn to stone.
*	Tiger eye rings, if exposed in unarmed combat with a tiger will burn
	it and do extra damage.
*	Weeping eyes (not just floating eyes) are targeted by ravens
*	Wizards with no spell hunger can cast when hungry
*	Extra pack rats due to load don't happen to low level characters
*	Add a few more items to shops
*	Various YAFMs, bogus-monsters etc.
*	Dwarves enjoy eating rats
*	You no longer find tins that smell like cows.
*	Add a woodchuck to the Oracle level
*	Food poisoning can sometimes be recovered from
*	Use the ISAAC64 RNG.


*	Bug fixes:
*	Misc bug/compiler warning/typo/etc. fixes.
*	Worm teeth, crysknives and sacrificial knives don't change material
*	Fix the awkward "silver iron hook" description (grappling hook)
*	Fix Drakemother generation
*	Fix a display bug (clumsy conduct)
*	Fix behaviour of eating an amulet of nausea
*	Fix "iron elven arrows" (inventory with race specific changes was
	having its object type changed after the material was assigned)
*	Cartomancers only get to keep cards played, not those destroyed.
*	Fix livelog "Is NetHack installed correctly!" messages
*	Confused scrolls of fire underwater fizzle like non-confused ones do.



************************************************************************
*	Release 0.0.1 'Trident'

*	Renamed as SliceHack.
*	Misc bug/typo/clean-up fixes, including removing Lord of the Foocubi
	references (the former Malcanthet)
*	Do silver damage fighting unarmed with fingerless gloves.
*	Misc YAFMs and silly names (hallucinating, mostly).
*	Fumbling potions - you try to drink with greasy fingers and whoops,
	you dropped it.
*	Sitting on an egg. Egg-layers are safe, other heroes splat it - yes,
	this is YA way to be killed by a cockatrice.
*	Exploding your bag of holding is no longer time to #quit. You'll lose
	a few items though, and the others will be thrown around the room.
	Fragile items may break, and anything could end up in a pool or lava.
*	Climbing boots. Allows you to climb stairs (or descend safely) when
	Strained, safely climb into a known pit/trapdoor/hole, get out of a
	pit in one turn, and squeeze past a boulder with more inventory.
*	Mined gems will not be glass.
*	You can get a wish from a wand of wonder - if it's the wrest charge.
	As well as the 1/30 chance of picking wishing there is a Luck check.
*	Magic chests - ported from dNethack - a container with shared
    contents - items put into a magic chest can be retrieved from any
    other magic chest. It can be moved, but it's very heavy. The contents
    don't add anything to the weight, though.
*	Magic bags - this light item allows items to be put into the magic
	chest, but not retrieved.
*	Removed the requirement that total object probability must be 1000
*	There are now 57 varieties of Sokoban. They came from Slex with major
	changes - the overall power/deadliness level has been much reduced
	from Slex, but it should still be more of a challenge than before.
*	From Fourk: Altars show the BUC status of the contents of a container
	without having to remove it.
*	Monsters (very) occasionally have an AoR
*	Added showweight / invweight options, like SlashEM - your current and
	maximum encumbrance on the status bar, and the weight shown with all
	inventory items.
*	Can wish for a magic lamp - maybe - it's Luck based - or doubloons.
*	Angels may carry Unlimited Moon, or a shield of resonance.
*	Allow a (fatal) attempt to ride an unsaddled cockatrice.
*	More packrats appear if you are heavily loaded.
*	More trees early, less late. Statues and fountains on Oracle level.


                        SpliceHack -- Changelog
                    
                    Version 0.7.0: Stranger Days

Cooking
- Cooking is done through the extended #cook command.
- Cooking uses the cooking skill. Raising this skill increases the chances
  of successfully cooking a corpse. The cooking skill can be increased by
  cooking food.
- Cooking a corpse increases nutrition the chance to gain an intrinsic, but 
  overcooking greatly reduces that chance and have lower nutrition. Cooked
  food is less likely to be rotted, and more likely to be safe to eat.
- Rotten and homemade tinned food is considered to be uncooked, but all
  other tins found by the player are treated as having a random amount of
  cooking. Corpses found in ice boxes have a small chance of being cooked.
- Monsters killed via fire usually leave burned corpses.
- Cooked corpses cannot be sacrificed.
- Cooking in front of a monster of the same race as the corpse being cooked
  will cause them to become angry.

Dungeon Changes
- The Banquet Hall, found in the level just above Mine's End. A very large
  throne room containing numerous dwarves and giants. Loot includes historic
  statues, potions of booze, kegs, and a throne.
- The Dark Forest. Contains a gauranteed moonstone, gaurded by an army of
  bizarre werecreatures.

Endgame Rewrite
- The following levels are now part of the endgame:
  - The City of Brass
    - City with shops inside the plane of fire.
  - The Gemstone Array
    - Earthquakes occur regularly in this level. It is filled
      with many boulders, and many crystal golems.
  - The Eternal Storm
    - Unlike the plane of air, this level is completely dark.
- On each plane, one of the seven deadly sins appears. They are
  not required to beat the game, and are very dangerous, so
  avoiding them is highly important.
- Upon performing the ascension ritual, all monsters generated only
  in gehennom can be generated throughout the regular dungeon.

Monsters
- New Monster: Fat Cat
    - A large cat can grow up into a fat cat, but only by eating

Roles, Races, and Character Creation
- Sexual Orientation
  - Sexual orientation affects whether you are seduced by succubi, incubi,
    both, or neither.
  - Options are gay, lesbian, bisexual, and asexual.
  - Please note that this is an experimental implementation, and as such
    only a few orientations are included, and the in-game representation
    may not be a perfect reflection of real life. This is a work in
    progress.
  - Sexual orientation is defined in the rc file.
- Nonbinary Gender
  - Resolved numerous bugs and corner cases which would cause the player
    to be referred to incorrectly. Nonbinary characters should be referred
    to with they/them pronouns in all cases.
  - Nonbinary characters are more likely to receive prompts on armor removal
    via foocubus.
  - Nonbinary characters cannot lay eggs.
  - Eggs hatched in the inventory of nonbinary characters always hatch
    peaceful monsters.
  - Nonbinary characters are not seduced by incubi or succubi, unless
    they are bisexual.

  - Dwarf Barbarian
  - Dwarf Cartomancer
  - Dwarf Knight

  - Drow Rogue
  - Orc Monk
  - Orc Pirate
  - Orc Priest
  - Gnome Pirate
  - Gnome Rogue
- New Race: Vampire
  - Ported vampires from Slash'em.
  - The race is fully intact, although this was far harder to port to 3.6.x
    than any other piece of code I have encountered.
  - Vampires have a few additional roles available.
  - Vampires CANNOT drain blood from cooked corpses.
- New Role: Convict
  - Added the Convict Patch, originally written by Karl Garrison. The
    convict role is now fully 3.6.x compatible.
- Dragonmaster Changes 
  - Dragonmasters now start with a random type of pet dragon (except
    black).
  - Dragons summoned by the Dragon Call technique only have a 50%
    chance of being friendly, and the baby dragons can be of any
    type.
  - Dragonmasters can no longer eat dragons without it being considered
    cannibalism. In exchange, they gain intrinsics on level up. This is
    from SliceHack.
- Cartomancer Changes
  - Every time a cartomancer kills a monster, there is a 1/20 chance that a
    spell card of create monster drops instead of a corpse. This card 
    (unless cursed) will summon a tame version of the monster to fight by
    the side of the player.
  - Cartomancers start with create monster scrolls keyed to random monsters.
  - The Soul of the Cards technique gives the cartomancer a card which might
    fix their current problem (or a random card otherwise) and instantly
    reads it.
  - Cartomancers can use decks of cards as if blessed.
  - Cartomancers have a new technique: Card Capture.
    Card Capture allows a cartomancer to morph a nearby monster into a
    spell card, then play that card to create a tame version of them.
- Merfolk Changes
  - Undertow has a failure rate
  - Remove turning 1/3 of levels into rivers.

Features

  by fire.

- Flipped levels patch has been enabled, after adding fixes from UnNetHack.
- Unique names for junk shop and archery shop shopkeers.
- Wands of psionics now have an engrave message, as requested by Hothraxxa.
- YAFM when praying near a praying mantis.
- Additional sounds and YAFMS for chatting with various monsters.
- Monsters in the endgame attempt to find altars to sacrifice the amulet on
  if they manage to steal it.
- Crowning grants the player character a unique technique dependent on their
  alignment.
- Improved formatting for the technique menu.
- Masks are generated randomly from the list of monsters, making the chance 
  of obtaining a useful mask much higher.
- Track the number of techniques used in a game as a conduct.
- Track the celibate conduct.
- Withering status effect. Blocks normal HP regeneration, and causes the
  player to lose 1 HP per turn. Having regeneration and withering at the
  same time nullifies HP regeneration, but there is no HP loss over time.

Fixes
- Purple dragons breathe "A wave of pure sound" instead of merely breathing
  sonic.
- Switched to using aosdict's fix for object probabilities over 1000.
- Holographic Void Lily has correctly attributed effects, and no longer
  relies on a massive kludge in order to function.
- Expensive cameras used by monsters will hurt players that are polymorphed into
  light-hating monsters.
- Fixed boabhan-sith spawning as random monsters.
- Fixed intelligent pet patch issue where monsters would repeatedly wield polearms.
- Fixed intelligent pet patch issue where monsters would treat polearms as having
  the same range as bows, and would stand motionless far away from the player.
- Fixed inconsistent cause of death across livelog, top ten list, and gravestone
  when receiving a random death message.
- Fixed monster steeds not teleporting with their masters, lagging behind by
  one turn.
- Fixed bad feedback when monster steeds have invisible riders.
- Unintentional fallthrough when chatting with types of djinn.
- Numerous other minor bugs.
- Named figurines applied by monsters create named monsters.
- Fixed some feedback issues when monsters offer on altars.
- Fixed players polymorphed into non-shapeshifting vampires being prompted to
  shapeshift.
- High score list is no longer checked in marathon mode.
- Fixed a bug where turning undead as a knight would consistently fail.
- Switched psychic rays color from blue to magenta.

Balance Changes
- Pull Under now has a failure rate, so that players do not use it to reliably
  slay boss monsters. The higher your level and the lower the monster's level,
  the more likely it is for the attack to succed.
- Scrolls of time cause the reader to become more hungry, and grant less
  movement points. This is in order to prevent abuse in the endgame.
- Nerfed Banshees. Previously, they bypassed fixed abilities and deafness,
  and could sap an endgame character's strength in only a few turns.
- Gae Bulg disappears with 100% certainty after successfully being thrown to 
  kill a monster. This event is livelogged if playing on a public server.
- Scrolls of scare monster no longer have any effect on unique monsters.

                    Version 0.6.4: Broken Things

Features
- New sounds for birds. They now let you know if you are abusing them.
- New monster gaze attacks implemented for polymorphed players.
- Changed how amalgamations and bad clones function.
    - This was a difficult but necessary decision. Amalgamations and
      bad clones were too buggy and poorly implemented to continue on
      as they were. They now function as regular monsters, but
      occasionally use the attacks of random, level-appropriate monsters
      in place of their own. Hopefully this system is less frustrating.

New Monsters
- Molydeus:
    - Molydei are one of the most dangerous monsters in the game. They are high
      level, and able to dish out a lot of damage with their greataxes.
    - Any creature hit by their bite attack has a chance of being polymorphed
      into a manes. Poison resistance reduces the chance of this occurring, but
      will not prevent it. The only way to truly be safe is to be unchanging.
    - In order to balance them, they cannot summon any type of demon through
      hell-p, just more manes.
    - If a player polymorphs into one, all demon lords will be automatically
      hostile to them.
    - Due to their abilities, Molydei are one of the best choices for pets.
      Conversely, they are one of the most dangerous to your own pets.
- Hippo
    - Hippos are fairly unremarkable. They yawn when angry, just like real
      hippos. They are also quite dangerous and aggressive, just like real
      hippos.

Bug Fixes
- Numerous fixes to monster steeds.
- Fixed glyph traps exploding in blasts of lightning.
- Fixed Dal Zethire instantly dying.
- Alucard no longer begins polymorphed, which should fix the bad weapon restore
  errors players were running into during Junethack.
- Many other fixes.

                    Version 0.6.3: Junethack Ahoy!

Features
- Modified XNetHack / SLASH'EM fungus growth. Generating mold warriors is
  highly unlikely.
- Addition of G_PLANES and G_NOPLANES tags. The SLASH'EM angels and devas
  can only be generated in the planes. Marids no longer generate in the planes.
  This should allow greater control over the late game, and hopefully make the
  planes feel a little bit more distinctive.
- Began selectively implementing maps and features from the Lethe patch.

Special Rooms
- Added L's Dilapidated Armory Patch.
- Improved abandoned laboratories.
- Reduced frequency of felines in dens.

New Items
- Spiked Chains: Combine the best features of polearms and melee weapons. This
  is a reference to D&D 3.5, where spiked chains are horrifyingly broken.
- Encyclopedias: Contain identities of a number of items.


New Monsters
- From SLASH'EM:
    - Movanic Deva
    - Mondadic Deva
    - Astral Deva
    - Planetar
    - Solar
- Zuggotomoy
    - Zuggotomoy's passive attack does random elemental damage, and she can
      infest corpses to create aspects of herself. She is extremely dangerous,
      but has no lair as of yet.
- Aspect of Zuggotomoy

Bug Fixes
- Stabilized amalgamations and gels.
- Various other fixes.
- Fixed numerous issues with ghouls.
- Fixed bug that caused fell beasts to spawn normally.

                    Version 0.6.2: Critical Errors

  them to stunlock the player.

- T-Rexes have been changed from white to red for clarity purposes.
- Removed rooks. In terms of flavor, they simply do not fit, and are not
  interesting.

- Whirlwind Trap

Bug Fixes
- Numerous fixes from SliceHack.
- Wandering cacti are no longer smart.
- Drop bears no longer hide in the floor.
- Statues are no longer colored in tiled mode.
- Artifact materials can no longer be warped.
- Blood puddings no longer drop stacks of zero potions.
- Various other fixes.
- Fixed pirates being more well-equiped than they should be.
- Fixed magma elementals not being buffed on the plane of fire.

                    Version 0.6.0 - Diversity and Danger

Tiles
- SpliceHack is now 100% tiles-compatible, and tested as such! Rejoice!

Nonbinary Characters
- Characters can now be nonbinary! For now, this is largely cosmetic, as the
  game treats them like female characters. This will change in the future once
  there is feedback on what differences should exist.
- As a side-effect, many roles are renamed for nonbinary characters, such as
  "Caveperson" and "Magister."

Patches Introduced
- SLASH'EM techniques have been implemented.
- Updated XNetHack object materials patch.
- Livelogging of players killing their own pet (XNetHack).
- SGrunt's intelligent pets patch has been implemented and updated for 3.6.
  - This means that casting monster spells when polymorphed is possible.
  - Monsters will use ranged weapons, attacks, and spells to attack one another.

Balance Changes
- Scroll writing costs have been adjusted in order to cut down on abuse of
  scrolls of knowledge and time. Previous strategies with a magic marker
  involved writing a half-dozen scrolls of knowledge, identifying everything
  one would need for the rest of the game, and then writing a ton of time
  scrolls to breeze through Astral. Scrolls of time are as expensive to write
  as genocide, while scrolls of knowledge cannot be written at all.
- Ported FIQHack's XP Curve, which mean leveling up happens more often in the
  endgame.
- Monster application of figurines now functions more similarly to how the
  player applies figurines, meaning that the monsters generated are not always
  aggressive.
- Helms of Opaque Thoughts now block mind flayer attacks to the head.
- Rings of Memory prevent forgetting spells over time.
- Will-o'-wisps nerfed again.
- Gnolls use '9' instead of 'G' to avoid minesflayer-like incidents.
- Barghests have a luck-stealing gaze.
- Amalgamations and Bad Clones much less common.
- Ancient Brain is now more useful to eat.
- Spectres only generate when the player is level 15 or above now.
- Reflective monsters do not chug potions of reflection.
- Hurtling into a wall no longer paralyzes you for the duration of your would-be
  hurtle. This prevents wind monsters from being able to stunlock enemies
  against walls.

Role and Race Changes
- Cartomancers play completely differently now. They can identify the rarity of
  various cards, and when they play a card in range of the monster that monster
  has a chance to respond with a card of their own. Cartomancers also have
  access to several new techniques. Hopefully, all of this should combine to
  make them a more interesting role to play.
- Dragonmasters have access to completely new techniques. Their quest has been
  modified, with the nemesis actually riding the dragon. They also actually have
  a decent selection of skills now.
- Master Kaen can block the pummel technique of a monk.
- Merfolk are a much stronger race than before, since they get access to one of
  the most powerful techniques in the game. As a tradeoff, levels often generate
  with rivers in them.
- The role selection for infernals and merfolk has changed.
- The lycanthrope race functions very similarly to SLASH'EM's werewolf race now.

Dungeon Changes
- Gehennom is now extremely compact, and the second fake wizard's tower has
  been removed.
- The main branch of the dungeon is ten levels longer, and you can encounter a
  big room up to three times.
- The first level of Vlad's tower includes a massive courtyard and is guarded by
  Alucard.
- The void has been reinstated and completely reworked. It still contains a void
  dragon and dangerous monsters, but now holds portals to many different points
  across the dungeon. You cannot use this in order to bypass the ascension run,
  so don't even think about it.

New Monsters
- Ported shambling horrors from Unnethack. Given the numerous damage types in
  SpliceHack, they can end up being absolutely ridiculous.
- Various Fantastical Plants (characterized by high magic resistance, low speed,
  and vulnerability to drain):
  - Walking Oak
  - Walking Birch
  - Walking Willow
  - Creeping Kudzu
  - Giant Sundew
  - Wander Cactus
  - Crazy Cactus
- Lots of Bears:
  - Bear
  - Drop Bear
  - Hellbear
  - Werebear
- Ported a large number of monsters from SLASH'EM:
  - Assassin Bug
  - Spitting Beetle
  - Glowing Eye
  - Bloodshot Eye
  - Blinking Eye
  - Deep One
  - Deeper One
  - Deepest One
  - Acid Worm
  - Ogre Mage
  - Wax Golem
  - Quickling
  - Genetic Engineer
  - Hellbat
  - Hellrat
  - Hellcat
- Ported some monsters from the biodiversity patch:
  - Umbral Hulk
  - Hunger Hulk
  - Nosferatu
- Many all-new miscellaneous monsters
  - Yuki-Onna
  - Substance Warper
  - Alucard
  - Anubite
  - Mad Alchemist
  - Herald Archon
  - Avenger Archon
  - Brood Wasp
  - Baby Brood Wasp
  - Korrupt Kop
  - Boar
  - Brown Mold Warrior
  - Yellow Mold Warrior
  - Green Mold Warrior
  - Red Mold Warrior
  - Nonbinary player monsters (various)

New Objects
- Aligned scrolls have been replaced with scrolls of air, warp weapon, and warp
  material, all of which are infinitely more interesting and more useful.
- Medical Kits and associated items from SLASH'EM. Pills cannot grant wishes, so
  don't even think about it.
- Potions of blood and vampire blood from SLASH'EM. Non-vampires can chuck blood
  at you, if they somehow manage to get ahold of it.

Miscellaneous Changes
- Powerful unique monsters now get fullscreen entrance messages.
- Refactored demon glyph colors so they are easier to tell apart.
- Additional tips, t-shirts, epitaphs, and the like.
- Monsters use many more items, such as potions of blood, booze, and expensive
  cameras.
- Weapons can be named after players on the high score list.
- Several YAFMs.
- Scrolls of knowledge yield much more intelligible messages.
- Farlook now gives better information about amalgamations and bad clones.
- Monsters that eat objects can now gain intrinsics. This makes Tasmanian devils
  potentially very dangerous, if they get their hands on the right corpses.
- Added various monster sounds.
- Tourist player monsters spawn with expensive cameras, and knights are
  automatically mounted on ponies.
- Drinking alcohol is tracked throughout the game.
- Pets avoid eating chameleons.
- Pets avoid attacking porcupines.

Bug Fixes
- Quilled monsters actually work. Apparently they have been bugged since the
  initial release of SpliceHack.
- Monster roaring works as intended.
- Sphere spells function when unskilled.
- Fixed many crashes related to monsters riding monsters.
- Various fixes to cartomancer language.
- Dragonmasters no longer get crashes when their steeds attempt to free them
  from a monster's stomach.
- Black Market guards no longer swarm the player infinitely.
- Refactored One-Eyed Sam's equipment so she is actually as dangerous as
  intended.
- Fixed many improper weapon damage bonuses.
- Fixed segfault when attacked by a leprechaun.
- Fixed ooze dragons and razor dragons dropping the wrong scales.
- Malcanthet no longer spontaneously renames herself.
- Too many others to count.


                    Version 0.5.0 - Balance and the Bizarre

Patches Introduced
- SpliceHack now uses xnethack's object materials patch.
- SpliceHack uses xnethack's randomly named weapons, originally ported from
  NetHack Fourk. SpliceHack's version functions differently, however, and
  generates a different set of names.

Balance Changes
- Nerfed lamassu damage output.
- Nerfed amalgamations slightly. Additionally, amalgamations now use a
  completely different and much better naming system that fits in the game
  more naturally.
- Disabled dungeon crumbling feature. This may be reinstated upon feedback.
- The demon lords that appear due to performing the ritual are no longer
  covetous, preventing the player from being mobbed and randomly killed during
  the ascension.
- Nerfed psionic attacks so that they no longer confuse the player.
- The lord of the foocubi is now renamed to Malcanthet, and has been heavily
  nerfed.

Role and Race Changes
- Infernals use their own race tag, which changes their class selection
  slightly.
- Silver items generate more often for infernal characters, making the role
  much more harrowing to play.
- Infernals are now fire resistant instead of having infravision.
- Pirates no longer always get a message about rising as skeletal pirates.
- Cartomancers use a refactored language system.

Dungeon Changes
- New branch: Ice wastes. A creepy level covered in ice and snow, with an orb
  of permafrost at the end. This level is important in that it also has a
  guaranteed pair of earmuffs, so it is much easier to find something for
  sonic resistance during a run.
- New branch: Mysterious laboratory. This laboratory is run by mind flayers, and
  they are not thrilled to be interrupted. The level contains numerous
  spellbooks as loot.

New Monsters (12)
- Failure Eidolon, a unique monster appearing in the ice wastes. It can
  teleport the player.
- Ancient Brain, a unique monster appearing in the laboratory. It cannot move,
  but can fire psychic rays and cast spells.
- Nuckelavee, a new type of demon with poison breath.
- Cheshire cats. They are very rare and only spawn in Gehennom. They have
  displacement, and making them invisible gives YAFM.
- Ported SLASH'EM's Zouthern animals, of which there are eight. Some of these
  animals have had their damage output nerfed from SLASH'EM in order to match
  the balance of SpliceHack.
- Animated statues have been completely removed and replaced with chess rooks,
  which like grid bugs can only move in straight lines.

New Objects (3)
- Orb of permafrost, an orb that causes an icy explosion when thrown.
- Spellbooks of flame sphere and freeze sphere, which function nearly
  identically to SLASH'EM. These necessitated changing the AI for explosive pets
  slightly.

Miscelaneous Changes
- All monsters can potentially gain intrinsics by eating, not just pets. This
  makes gelationous cubes and tasmanian devils slightly more dangerous since
  they consume everything in their path.
- Monsters can now use magic flutes and rarely drums of earthquake.
- Updated the database with many new monsters.
- YAFM when a tornado engulfs a Cartomancer (Luxidream).
- Pets now produce a message when they level up.
- Ants now have a special sound when #chatted with.
- Added a few more monsters to summon nasties.
- Monsters that can jump now notify you when you polymorph into them.
- Changed the piece of cloth into a dusty cloak (xnethack).
- Looking at a monster no longer displays whether they are armored, but does
  tell you the material of their weapon.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed doors being rendered in the wrong color.
- Updated to current version of vanilla NetHack.
- Fixed health food stores causing segfaults (msearle5).
- Monsters with steeds and ridden monsters no longer follow you to other levels,
  thus preventing a number of segfaults and bugs.
- Spellcasters with no arms no longer point at you before cursing.
- Fixed some monster sound bugs.
- Monsters now actually attempt to throw their throwing axes.
- Fixed legendary lichen corpses being treated differently than lichens.
- Fixed silver haters being gifted silver artifacts.
- Fixed silver haters starting the game with silver items. The items in their
  inventory are set to iron instead of silver, regardless of the type. This is
  a kludge.
- Fixed overly powerful reaver, and a few erroneous damage values for weapons.
- Fixed a lot of black market related bugs, including continual guards and
  thiefbane not being wielded. This means that One-Eyed Sam now wears a cloak
  of reflection and hex dragon scale mail.
- Fixed amalgamations bugging out when engulfing.

Known Bugs
- Pets can be taken into the Black Market, but not out of it.
- Some races are improperly tagged.

                    Version 0.4.0 - QOL and Life Improvement

Major Patches
- Implemented a heavily modified version of the descriptive hit messages patch
  by L, and combined it with SpliceHack's existing monk hit messages.
- Changes from NetHack 3.6.2B were pulled into the game.
- Chris's Pirate patch was implemented, thus adding the pirate role to the game.
  Updating this to be compatible with 3.6.1 took quite a bit of work, so for
  those trying to add it to 3.6.1 I would recommend looking at what I did here.
- Added the Black Market from Unnethack/SLASHEM, using the code in Unnethack.
  The market functions largely the same as the one in SLASHEM, although there
  are a few small differences due to porting the code from 3.4.3 to 3.6.x
  (see below).
- Implemented an altered version of the colored walls and floors patch by L.
  Only walls are colored, and the Valley of the Dead is not in grayscale. In
  addition, some branches have new wall colors.

QOL Changes
- Dropped the quest entry requirement to level 10.
- Ported paranoid trap and swim confirmation from xnethack.
- Ported peaceful monster displacement from xnethack.
- Ported NAO 3.4.3's hilite_hidden_stairs option to 3.6.x and SpliceHack.
  Defaults to true.
- Artifact wishing is based on the number of artifacts wished for, not
  generated, preventing the increased  number of artifacts from nerfing artifact
  wishing.
- The vibrating square can now be teleported onto directly (YANI by Mandevil)
- New messages when monsters pursue you up or down dungeon levels (YANI by
  aosdict)
- There are now messages for triggering teleport and level teleport traps.
- Void level disabled (for now).
- Looking at monsters provides additional information, such as whether they can
  jump or be domesticated.

Balance Changes
- Nerfed Lord of the Foocubi and Will-o'-the-wisps after player feedback.
- Nerfed mind flayer telepath damage.
- Only dragons can randomly roar now, as opposed to any monster with MS_ROAR.
- Reduced the number of marids and giant eels on the plane of water.
- Monsters can only get wishes from smoky potions now, not wands of
  wishing. Wishes for wands of death and archon figurines were removed.
- Several artifacts were buffed. The most noticeable buff is to dismounter,
  which now does extra damage and throws a rider from their horse, making them
  automatically stunned. This is particularly useful against the new riders.
- Luckless Folly now must be wished for, and will probably be added as a prize
  for a branch at some point.
- Amalgamtions now grab totally random monsters to make a part of themselves.
  For balance purposes, their speed has been massively nerfed. Regardless,
  tangle with them at your own peril.

New Monsters (21, but only 8 spawn randomly)
- Ported Gnolls, Gnoll Shamans, and Gnoll Chieftains from SLASH'EM.
- Added Lampades, high-level nymphs appearing in Gehennom.
- Added Pack Lords, which transform into Alpha Werewolves. Alpha Werewolves
  transmit regular lycanthropy, and can (rarely) summon normal werewolves.
- Added ratmen and mutated ratmen. Both are low-level monsters that spawn
  randomly.
- Headless horseman, a demon that spawns riding a nightmare.
- A pale horse, white horse, and black horse, which only appear on the Astral
  Plane and are ridden by their respective Riders.
- The pirate patch adds damned pirates, skeletal pirates, parrots, Mayor
  Cumberbund, Blackbeard's Ghost, pirates, pirate brothers, and planar pirates.
  These are not usually encountered unless one is a pirate.
- One-Eyed Sam the Arms Dealer runs the Black Market.

New Objects (4)
- Ring of Blood Magic: If you do not have enough energy to cast a spell, you
  cast it anyway, but lose hit points equal to the excess energy. Casting
  healing spells using blood magic will deal extra damage to you in order to
  prevent skill farming.
- Ring of Psychic Resistance: One of the few ways in the game to become
  resistant to psionic attacks.
- Ring of Memory: Blocks the forgetting of items, spells, and objects.
  Essentially amnesia resistance.
- Scrolls of Knowledge: Essentially scrolls of reverse identify, like those
  that appear in Nethack, the Next Generation. Reading one will allow you to
  identify any item in the game by prompt.

New Artifacts (4)
- Chest of Proteus: The pirate quest artifact. Catches curses and occasionally
  polymorphs the items placed inside it. The polypiler's dream.
- Reaver: An artifact scimitar. The crowning gift for pirates.
- Marauder's Map: An artifact scroll of magic mapping. Sacrifice gift for
  pirates. Can also be invoked to detect artifacts.
- Thiefbane: Wielded by One-Eyed Sam. Identical to Thiefbane in Unnethack.

New Features
- Pets can gain intrinsics through corpses in the same way that the player can.
- Water walking has been implemented for monsters, and functions exactly how one
  would expect.
- Displacement has been implemented for monsters. A displaced monster has a 1/4
  chance of being someplace else when it is melee-d, and then surprising you.
  Displacement can be bypassed using see invisible or telepathy. This feature is
  subject to change on player feedback.
- Monsters can jump. This essentially allows them to do a short range teleport
  to the player if there is an available jumping path.
- All monsters can now gain displacement, water walking, and jumping from
  appropriate items.
- Monsters are now capable of riding steeds. Currently only headless horsemen
  and the Riders ride steeds. Each of the riders is mounted on an appropriate
  high-level horse.

Role and Race Changes
- Improved Cartomancer energy levels, which were very low due to a missing case
  in a switch statement.
- Cartomancer basement is now a mines level.
- Easter egg for Cartomancers that read credit cards.
- Chromatic dragons are treated as domestic for Dragonmasters, meaning (among
  other things) that they can be tamed.
- Dragonmasters slowly regenerate energy when standing next to pet dragons.
  Additionally, pet dragons will attempt to help a dragonmaster who is slimed,
  asleep, or stuck.
- As noted above, the pirate role is now available.

Miscelaneous Changes and Bug Fixes
- Fixed the alignment of monsters being compared incorrectly when seeing whether
  they would sacrifice something on an altar.
- Fixed a segfault relating to monsters being gifted a nonexistent item from an
  altar.
- Fixed monsters not picking up corpses to sacrifice. All of these fixes make
  monster sacrifice on altars much more likely to occur, especially in minetown.
- Landsharks are no longer slithy.
- Martial artists and martial masters use monk hit messages.
- Landsharks and Jumping Spiders are capable of jumping. Polymorphing into
  either of these monsters will grant the ability to jump.
- Completely reworked Mephisto's lair.
- The Grim Reaper is now drain resistant.
- Earmuffs are now referred to as "a pair of earmuffs" instead of "earmuff,"
  fixing one of the longest running bugs in SpliceHack.
- Game pluralizes "worm that walks" as "worms that walk," as opposed to the
  Gollum-esque "worms that walkses."
- Psychic and sonic resistance now appear in the enlightenment menu.
- Permanent versus temporary hallucination is now displayed correctly based on
  roleplay options.
- Added a few random god names.
- Added new sounds for pirates, all zombies, cows, and giant flies.
- Due to the way that shopkeepers changed from 3.4.3 to 3.6.x, simply using
  PM_ONE_EYED_SAM results in (at best), "One-Eyed Sam the One-Eyed Sam", and
  segfaults due to shopkeeper struct initialization at worst. Thus, she now
  uses the Arms Dealer monster entry.
- Domestic birds can now fly, as they were supposed to be able to.
- Riders now carry their appropriate implements, and resurrect with special
  messages.
- Merfolk are generated hostile now, so killing them no longer counts as
  murder.
- Mind flayer telepaths are now treated as mind flayers.
- Magma elementals no longer say that they dissolved into magma without
  actually dissolving into magma.
- Silver dragons and baby silver dragons no longer quaff potions of reflection.
- Desert jinn no longer leave corpses.
- Fixed a bug where enlightenment could not be duplicated by a wand of wonder.
- Fixed amalgamations rarely randomly segfaulting on initialization.

Known Bugs
- Currently, it is possible to take your pet into the black market, but not
  back out. I know why this bug exists but have not been able to solve it.
